### Forecasting with ARIMA
This small project is an introduction on detecting trend and seasonality in time series data sets, applying an optimized ARIMA model to it, and finally forecast what near future data looks like.

I used the [Digital Music dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) and adapted this project from [this amazing tutorial](https://www.datascience.com/blog/introduction-to-forecasting-with-arima-in-r-learn-data-science-tutorials?hs_amp=true). All my work is in program.R.

Required libraries:

   + `ggplot2`

   + `forecast`
   
   + `tseries`
   
   + `rjson`
   
   + `lubridate`
   
   + `cowplot`
